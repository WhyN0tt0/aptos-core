# Vector Load Test

The purpose of this module is to test the performance of creating large vectors and writing to them in Move. This type of txn is useful for load testing due to the high gas cost and large writesets.

This module was inspired by [banool/aptos-canvas](https://github.com/banool/aptos-canvas).
